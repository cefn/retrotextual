# Board layout

See also graphics under images/layout

Boards are in quadrants which are 1000mm from the side of one frosting panel to the other.

The 30mm separation between frosting is reflected also in the boards, including an equivalent 30mm surround, mirroring the space around every frosting lozenge. However, to allow a 10mm gap between boards, the surround provided where the boards join is actually 10mm, meaning 10mm on each board and a 10mm gap, totalling 30mm. 

Two 25mm black velcro strips should be attached on receiving the 20pixel strips, using their provided self-adhesive on a clean plastic surplus element (leaving the existing self-adhesive pads intact. From the 25mm black hook+loop we need therefore 2 x 17mm (the depth of for each of 160 rectangular pixels on each of 20 boards.

17*2*160*20 = 96000 or 96 metres of both hook and loop. Need both sides of velcro material, So 100m Hook and 100m Loop.
